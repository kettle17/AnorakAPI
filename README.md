# ðŸš‚ðŸš‚ AnorakAPI ðŸš‚ðŸš‚
This repository is an implementation for a train API according to the below specification.
It uses Spring Boot, Gradle, and a Firebase data repository to create a API instance.

## GET /train
Returns all current trains in the data repository with their ids, names, colours, and train numbers.

## GET /train/{id}
Returns the specific data of the chosen train id.

## GET /train/{id}/sightings
Returns a list of all sightings of that specific train, with station and timestamp metadata.

## GET /station
Returns all current stations in the data repository with their ids and names.

## POST /sightings
When posting a valid list of sightings in a format such as:
```
[
  {
    "train": { "name": "Express 1", "colour": "Red", "trainNumber": "12345" },
    "station": { "name": "London Euston" },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-25T17:35:42Z"
  },
  {
    "train": { "name": "Express 2", "colour": "Blue", "trainNumber": "67890" },
    "station": { "name": "King's Cross" },
    "timestamp": "2025-08-25T18:00:00Z"
  },
  ...
]
```
All information about the train, station, and the current sighting will be recorded onto the firebase data repository if it does not already exist. Existing stations and trains will be name-matched. It will not accept incorrect formatting.

      summary: Save sightings
      description: >
        We will receive a list of 1 or more sightings from the day. 

        Each one will contain a train, a station and time.

        The key logic is:

        1. If the train does not had an id, search the database for the train number. If the train does not exist, add it.
        2. If the station does not exist, add it. (note: All UK stations have unique names)
        3. Save the sighting

        If there is a schema validation error we should return an error without saving anything.
        If there is an error in some of the records, we should save what we can and return a 500 error with a list of the errors
